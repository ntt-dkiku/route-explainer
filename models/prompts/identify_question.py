IDENTIFY_QUESTION = """\
Given a route and a question that asks what would happen if we replaced a specific edge in the route with another edge, please extract the step number of the replaced edge (i.e., cf_step) and the node id of the destination of the new edge (i.e., cf_visit) from the question, which is written in natural language.
Please use the following examples as a reference when you answer:
***** START EXAMPLE *****
[route info]
Nodes(node id, name): (1, node1), (2, node2), (3, node3), (4, node4), (5, node5)
Route: node1 > (step1) > node5 > (step2) > node3 > (step3) > node2 > (step4) > node4 > (step 5) > node1
[question] 
Why node3, and why not node2?
[outputs]
```json
{{
    "success": true,
    "summary": "The answer asks about replacing the edge from node5 to node3 with the edge from node6 to node2.",
    "intent": "",
    â€œprocess": "The edge from node5 to node3 is at step2 because of "node5 > (step2) > node3". The node id of the destination of the new edge is 2 (node2). Thus, the final answers are cf_step=2 and cf_visit=2.",

[quetsion]
What if we visited node4 instead of node2? We would personally like to visit node4 first.
[outputs]
